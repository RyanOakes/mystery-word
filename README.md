#Mystery Word

##Synopsis

This program is a Hangman-style interactive game that pits user against computer.

The computer selects a random word (secret word) from a list. There are three difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard (the harder the difficulty, the more difficult/obscure the word.)

The user gets up to eight chances to successful guess the word, making one-letter attempts at a time. Repeated letter guesses and correct letter guesses do not count towards that eight-guess total.

The game continues until either the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of turns. At this point, they are prompted to play again - if they wish - or exit the program.
