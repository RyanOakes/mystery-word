#Mystery Word

The purpose of this game is to write a Hangman-style interactive game that pits user against computer.

The computer selects a random word (secret word) from a list. There are three difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard.

In easy mode, the secret word is between 4-6 letters.

IN medium mode, the secret word is between 6-8 letters.

In hard mode, the secret word is 8+ letters.

The user gets up to eight chances to successful guess the word, making one-letter attempts at a time. Repeated letter guesses and
correct letter guesses do not count towards that eight-guess total.

The game continues until either the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of turns. At this point, they are prompted to play again - if they wish - or exit the program.
